                date: "December 11, 2024",
                image: "Images/dji.jpg",
                content: "Lanka Milk Foods (CWE) PLC (LMF) has set an extraordinary benchmark at its Ambewela Farms, achieving a record-breaking daily milk production of 62,000 litres from a single source. This represents a truly massive growth from the 3,000 litres to 60,000 liters per day recorded. When the company took over the facility from the state sector in 2001 it started with less than 3000 liters daily production. Now contributing 20 million litres of milk annually to Sri Lanka’s national supply, Ambewela Farms exemplifies the transformative power of modernisation, expertise, and relentless dedication. This achievement is the result of years of meticulous planning, significant investments, and implementing innovative farming practices. A major milestone was reached in 2019 with the introduction of two automated dairy housing and milking systems, part of a 5-billion-rupee investment in modernisation. These systems doubled production capacity within two years, bringing the farm to world-class standards. Every detail, from dairy cow comfort to computerised management systems, reflects a commitment to excellence.The farms’ success stems not only from infrastructure but also from forward-thinking practices. An advanced breeding programme using sexed semen from globally renowned stud bulls has enabled the production of high-yielding cows locally. These genetically superior cows, comparable to the best commercial herds worldwide, produce an impressive 12,000 litres per 305-day lactation cycle. Furthermore, rigorous health surveillance and preventive measures ensure that the herd remains healthy and disease-free, maintaining productivity.Nutrition also plays a vital role in sustaining these high yields. With guidance from international nutritionists, the farm employs precision feeding systems tailored to meet the needs of high-yielding cows. Additionally, purpose-bred grass varieties, imported and cultivated on the farm’s pastures, provide optimal nutrition. Advanced feeding and care systems for calves ensure superior growth and early maturity, resulting in continual improvements in herd productivity. This has resulted in dairy cows at Ambewela Farms producing an average of up to 40 litres of milk per cow, per day. Reflecting on the achievement, General Manager Farms, Sarath Bandara said, “This milestone has been made possible through a collaborative approach, blending international expertise with the knowledge and dedication of our local teams. It represents the culmination of years of hard work, strategic planning, and innovation. Having combined global knowledge with local expertise and commitment, we’ve set a new standard for dairy production in Sri Lanka. We remain committed to uplifting the dairy industry, and supporting national self-sufficiency through improved productivity and quality excellence.”The impact of the developments at Ambewela Farms reaches far beyond its own operations, as LMF shares its success with local farmers by providing high-quality offspring from its herds, empowering them to enhance productivity and adopt best practices. Driven by LMF’s strong belief in winning together as a nation, these initiatives are strengthening the country’s dairy sector and building a culture of continuous improvement. This is improving efficiency and self-sufficiency across Sri Lanka’s dairy industry, while bolstering Island’s food security, and highlights the potential of combining advanced technology, expert guidance, and sustainable practices. As LMF continues to set new benchmarks, the company remains steadfast in its mission to support Sri Lanka’s dairy industry, delivering unmatched quality to consumers, and upholding its position as a national leader in dairy production."
